# Tic Tac Toe: Human vs Human

# Didn't get this on my own - Create a 3 x 3 board: where each box is numbered from 1 to 3
#
# Done on my own - Code the winning condition: that is if boxes [1,2,3] all have only X or only O then the respective player wins
#
# Done on my own - If there is no winning condition then it's a draw
#
# Done on my own - Put all the above in a while true loop, at the end of each game ask the player if you wanna continue and if no then False.


# Looking over this skeleton, I notice that it is made up of about 6 main components:
#
# new_board - done, same as render
# render - done
# get_move - done
# make_move - done, same as get_move
# get_winner - done
# is_board_full - done


# works correctly

    # the 3 possible states - O, X and empty.
